## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.8)

### üîß FIXED: Excessive Console Logs in Friend System
- **Issue**: Console was being flooded with debug logs from friend system functions
- **Root Cause**: `loadFriendsList()` function contained many debug console.log statements that were called frequently
- **Solution**: Removed excessive debug logs while keeping essential ones for actual friend actions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Removed debug logs from `loadFriendsList()` function (friends data, deduplication, status checks)
  - Removed debug logs from button click handlers (accept/reject/unfriend)
  - Removed debug logs from `sendFriendRequest()`, `respondToFriendRequest()`, and `unfriendUser()` functions
  - Removed debug log from server-side friends endpoint
  - Kept essential console logs for actual friend events:
    - `üë• New friend request from [username]` - when receiving a friend request
    - `üë• Friend request accepted/rejected by [username]` - when a request is responded to
    - `üò¢ [username] unfriended you` - when someone unfriends you
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`, `multiplayer.js`, `server.js`
- **Result**: Console is now much cleaner, only showing important friend system events once

## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.7)

### üîß FIXED: Daily Challenges Not Counting Progress
- **Issue**: Daily challenges were not counting progress for watering plants, planting seeds, and other actions
- **Root Cause**: Missing `updateChallengeProgress()` calls in key game functions
- **Solution**: Added challenge progress updates to all relevant game actions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('water', 1)` to `waterPlant()` function
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('plant', 1)` to `plantSeed()` function
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('rare', 1)` and `updateChallengeProgress('legendary', 1)` to harvest function for rare/legendary plants
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('expansion', 1)` to `expandGarden()` function
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: All daily and weekly challenges now properly track progress for all supported challenge types

### üîß FIXED: Sprinkler Growth System Timing Issue
- **Issue**: Sprinklers were not growing plants due to timing initialization problem
- **Root Cause**: `lastSprinklerGrowth` was being initialized to current time, causing immediate 0 time difference on first check
- **Solution**: Modified `checkSprinklerGrowth()` to properly initialize timing on first call
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed timing logic to initialize `lastSprinklerGrowth` on first call and skip that frame
  - This ensures proper 30-second intervals between growth stages
  - Maintains existing growth rate multipliers and sprinkler bonus calculations
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: Sprinklers now properly grow plants at the intended rate (1 stage per 30 seconds)

## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.6)

### üîß FIXED: Friend Request Visibility Issue
- **Issue**: When a user already has an accepted friend, new pending friend requests were not visible
- **Root Cause**: The deduplication logic in `loadFriendsList()` was removing pending requests when an accepted friend relationship already existed for the same user
- **Solution**: Modified deduplication logic to consider both user ID AND status/request_type, preventing loss of pending requests
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed deduplication key from just user ID to `userID-status-requestType` combination
  - This ensures that pending requests and accepted friends for the same user are treated as separate entries
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs to track friend data processing
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: Pending friend requests are now visible even when users already have accepted friends

## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.5)

### üîß FIXED: Friend System Issues (Online Status & Unfriend Notifications)
- **Issue 1**: Only one friend was showing as online even when multiple friends were online
- **Root Cause**: The `updateMultiplayerUI()` function only refreshed the friends list when it was visible, causing online status updates to be missed when friends came online/offline
- **Solution**: Modified `updateMultiplayerUI()` in `game.js` to always refresh the friends list when friend online/offline events occur
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed the conditional logic in `updateMultiplayerUI()` from only refreshing when friends list is visible to always refreshing
  - This ensures that real-time online status updates are immediately reflected in the UI
  - Added debugging logs to track online status detection for better troubleshooting
- **Issue 2**: Users were not notified when someone unfriended them
- **Root Cause**: Missing client-side handler for the `user_unfriended` event that the server emits
- **Solution**: Added `user_unfriended` event handler in `multiplayer.js` to show notifications and refresh friends list
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `user_unfriended` event listener in `multiplayer.js` with proper notification display using game's `showMessage` system
  - Added automatic friends list refresh after unfriend notification to remove the unfriended user
  - Integrated with existing event system for consistent user experience
- **Files Modified**: `multiplayer.js`, `game.js`
- **Result**: All online friends now display correctly and users receive proper notifications when unfriended

## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.4)

### üîß FIXED: Friend System Issues (Targeted Fixes)
- **Issue 1**: Friend request notifications were not user-friendly on sender's side
- **Root Cause**: Basic alert messages were not descriptive enough and didn't use the game's notification system
- **Solution**: Enhanced `handleFriendRequestResponse` in `multiplayer.js` to show descriptive messages with emojis and use game's `showMessage` system
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified `handleFriendRequestResponse` function to display user-friendly messages like "üéâ John accepted your friend request! You are now friends."
  - Added automatic friends list refresh after friend request responses
  - Integrated with game's `showMessage` system for consistent UI experience
- **Issue 2**: Only one out of two friends was showing in friends list
- **Root Cause**: Filtering logic in `loadFriendsList` was too restrictive using `&&` instead of `||`
- **Solution**: Corrected filtering logic from `&&` to `||` for `acceptedFriends` to show all accepted friends
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed filter condition from `friend.status === 'accepted' && friend.request_type === 'accepted'` to `(friend.status === 'accepted') || (friend.request_type === 'accepted')`
  - This ensures friends are shown if either condition is met, not requiring both
- **Issue 3**: Basic friend request response messages needed improvement
- **Solution**: Enhanced `respondToFriendRequest` in `game.js` to show more descriptive and user-friendly messages
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Updated response messages to include emojis and clearer descriptions
  - Added different message types (success/info) based on acceptance/rejection
- **Files Modified**: `multiplayer.js`, `game.js`
- **Result**: Better friend request notifications and all accepted friends now display correctly

## üÜï Latest Updates (v1.7.3)

### üîß FIXED: Account Settings Data Loading
- **Issue**: "Error loading data" for member since and last login dates in account settings modal
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect API endpoint paths in `game.js` - functions were calling `/auth/profile` instead of `/api/auth/profile`
- **Solution**: Updated all account settings API calls to use correct `/api/auth/` prefix
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `game.js` - Fixed `loadAccountInfo()` function (line 6921)
  - `game.js` - Fixed `updateEmail()` function (line 6969) 
  - `game.js` - Fixed `changePassword()` function (line 7020)
- **Technical Details**: Server routes are mounted at `/api/auth` but client was calling `/auth`, causing 404 errors
- **Result**: Account information now loads correctly with proper member since and last login dates

### üé® REFINED: Account Settings Interface
- **Request**: User feedback to remove logout button and sound effects from account settings, and improve delete account functionality
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Removed**: Logout button from account settings modal (logout is available in main menu)

- **Issue**: User reported "the admin panel is buggy, there are 2 admin panels and it shows some code i think near the right of my screen"
- **Root Cause**: `index.html` contained duplicate admin modal HTML content that conflicted with the main `admin-panel.html` file
- **Solution**: Removed all duplicate admin panel HTML content from `index.html`
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Identified and removed large duplicate admin modal section from `index.html` (lines 732-1000)
  - Removed duplicate admin tabs, tab content, and modal structures
  - Kept only the `adminBtn` which correctly links to the separate `admin-panel.html`
  - Ensured clean separation between main game and admin panel functionality
- **Result**: Single, clean admin panel interface without duplication or code display issues

### üéÆ FIXED: Menu Button Layout and Authentication

### üîß FIXED: Ban and Mute Reason Requirements
- **Ban Endpoint Issue**: The `/api/admin/users/:userId/ban` endpoint was requiring a reason even when the UI indicated it was optional
  - **Root Cause**: Server-side validation `if (!reason) return error` was blocking requests without reasons
  - **Solution**: Modified endpoint to accept optional reasons with fallback to "No reason provided"
  - **Code Changes**: 
    - `admin.js` line 477: Replaced `if (!reason) return error` with `const banReason = reason || 'No reason provided'`
    - Updated all database operations to use `banReason` instead of `reason`
- **Permanent Mute Issue**: Permanent mutes were not being enforced due to SQL query logic errors
  - **Root Cause**: SQL queries using `datetime('now')` without timezone specification and incorrect NULL handling
  - **Solution**: Updated all mute-related queries to use `datetime('now', 'localtime')` and fixed NULL logic
  - **Code Changes**:
    - `server.js` line 471: Updated chat message mute check query
    - `admin.js` line 935: Updated muted users count query  
    - `auth.js` line 131: Updated login mute check query
- **Technical Details**:
  - The original query `(muted_until IS NULL OR muted_until > datetime('now'))` failed for permanent mutes
  - When `muted_until` is NULL, the condition `muted_until > datetime('now')` evaluates to NULL
  - `NULL OR NULL` is still NULL (falsy), so permanent mutes were not detected
  - Using `datetime('now', 'localtime')` ensures proper timezone handling
- **Mute Enforcement Logic Fix**: Fixed JavaScript logic that was preventing mute enforcement
  - **Issue**: Even after fixing SQL queries, mute enforcement was still not working for permanent mutes without reasons
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript conditions were too restrictive, requiring either `muted_until` or `mute_reason` to be non-null
  - **Solution**: Simplified mute enforcement logic to check only for the existence of mute data
  - **Code Changes**:
    - `server.js` line 482: Changed `if (muteData && (muteData.muted_until !== null || muteData.mute_reason !== null))` to `if (muteData)`
    - `auth.js` line 149: Changed `if (user.mute_reason !== null)` to `if (user.muted_until !== null || user.mute_reason !== null)`
- **Result**: 
  - Ban reasons are now truly optional as indicated in the UI
  - Permanent mutes now work correctly whether a reason is provided or not
  - Temporary mutes continue to work as expected

  - When `muted_until` is NULL, the condition `muted_until > datetime('now')` evaluates to NULL
  - `NULL OR NULL` is still NULL (falsy), so permanent mutes were not detected
  - Using `datetime('now', 'localtime')` ensures proper timezone handling
- **Mute Enforcement Logic Fix**: Fixed JavaScript logic that was preventing mute enforcement
  - **Issue**: Even after fixing SQL queries, mute enforcement was still not working for permanent mutes without reasons
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript conditions were too restrictive, requiring either `muted_until` or `mute_reason` to be non-null
  - **Solution**: Simplified mute enforcement logic to check only for the existence of mute data
  - **Code Changes**:
    - `server.js` line 482: Changed `if (muteData && (muteData.muted_until !== null || muteData.mute_reason !== null))` to `if (muteData)`
    - `auth.js` line 149: Changed `if (user.mute_reason !== null)` to `if (user.muted_until !== null || user.mute_reason !== null)`
- **Result**: 
  - Ban reasons are now truly optional as indicated in the UI
  - Permanent mutes now work correctly whether a reason is provided or not
  - Temporary mutes continue to work as expected
  - All mute enforcement is now consistent across login, chat, and admin functions
  - Mute enforcement logic now properly handles all mute types regardless of reason presence

- **Solution**: Enhanced reset function to properly reset all game data to initial state
- **Technical Details**:
  - Reset garden size to 8x8 and recalculate grid dimensions
  - Reset expansion cost to initial $5,000
  - Clear all plants and sprinklers from garden
  - Reset money, water, fertilizer, and score to starting values

- **Result**: Complete reset now properly returns game to initial state

### Garden Expansion Persistence Fix
- **Issue**: Garden size was resetting to 8x8 when switching save slots or reloading
- **Root Cause**: `gridSize` and `cellSize` were not being updated after loading `gardenSize` from save data
- **Solution**: Added proper initialization of `gridSize` and `cellSize` in the `loadGame()` function
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Updated `loadGame()` to set `this.gridSize = this.gardenSize` after loading garden size
  - Added `this.cellSize = Math.floor(600 / this.gridSize)` calculation
  - Ensures garden dimensions persist correctly across save slot switches
- **Result**: Garden expansion now properly persists when switching slots or reloading the game
