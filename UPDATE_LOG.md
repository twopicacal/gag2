## v1.7.8 - Friend System Console Log Cleanup

### üîß FIXED: Excessive Console Logs in Friend System
- **Issue**: Console was being flooded with debug logs from friend system functions
- **Root Cause**: `loadFriendsList()` function contained many debug console.log statements that were called frequently
- **Solution**: Removed excessive debug logs while keeping essential ones for actual friend actions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Removed debug logs from `loadFriendsList()` function (friends data, deduplication, status checks)
  - Removed debug logs from button click handlers (accept/reject/unfriend)
  - Removed debug logs from `sendFriendRequest()`, `respondToFriendRequest()`, and `unfriendUser()` functions
  - Removed debug log from server-side friends endpoint
  - Kept essential console logs for actual friend events:
    - `üë• New friend request from [username]` - when receiving a friend request
    - `üë• Friend request accepted/rejected by [username]` - when a request is responded to
    - `üò¢ [username] unfriended you` - when someone unfriends you
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`, `multiplayer.js`, `server.js`
- **Result**: Console is now much cleaner, only showing important friend system events once

## v1.7.7 - Daily Challenges & Sprinkler Growth Fixes

### üîß FIXED: Daily Challenges Not Counting Progress
- **Issue**: Daily challenges were not counting progress for watering plants, planting seeds, and other actions
- **Root Cause**: Missing `updateChallengeProgress()` calls in key game functions
- **Solution**: Added challenge progress updates to all relevant game actions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('water', 1)` to `waterPlant()` function
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('plant', 1)` to `plantSeed()` function
  - Added `updateChallengeProgress('rare', 1)` and `updateChallengeProgress('legendary', 1)` to harvest function for rare/legendary plants

- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: All daily and weekly challenges now properly track progress for all supported challenge types

### üîß FIXED: Sprinkler Growth System Timing Issue
- **Issue**: Sprinklers were not growing plants due to timing initialization problem
- **Root Cause**: `lastSprinklerGrowth` was being initialized to current time, causing immediate 0 time difference on first check
- **Solution**: Modified `checkSprinklerGrowth()` to properly initialize timing on first call
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed timing logic to initialize `lastSprinklerGrowth` on first call and skip that frame
  - This ensures proper 30-second intervals between growth stages
  - Maintains existing growth rate multipliers and sprinkler bonus calculations
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: Sprinklers now properly grow plants at the intended rate (1 stage per 30 seconds)

## v1.7.6 - Friend Request Display Fix

### üîß FIXED: Friend Request Visibility Issue
- **Issue**: When a user already has an accepted friend, new pending friend requests were not visible
- **Root Cause**: The deduplication logic in `loadFriendsList()` was removing pending requests when an accepted friend relationship already existed for the same user
- **Solution**: Modified deduplication logic to consider both user ID AND status/request_type, preventing loss of pending requests
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Changed deduplication key from just user ID to `userID-status-requestType` combination
  - This ensures that pending requests and accepted friends for the same user are treated as separate entries
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs to track friend data processing
- **Files Modified**: `game.js`
- **Result**: Pending friend requests are now visible even when users already have accepted friends

## v1.7.5 - Online Status & Unfriend Notification Fixes

### üîß FIXED: Friend System Issues (Online Status & Unfriend Notifications)
- **Issue 1**: Only one friend was showing as online even when multiple friends were online
- **Root Cause**: The `updateMultiplayerUI()` function only refreshed the friends list when it was visible, causing online status updates to be missed
- **Fix**: Modified `updateMultiplayerUI()` in `game.js` to always refresh the friends list when friend online/offline events occur
- **Issue 2**: Users were not notified when someone unfriended them
- **Root Cause**: Missing client-side handler for the `user_unfriended` event
- **Fix**: Added `user_unfriended` event handler in `multiplayer.js` to show notifications and refresh friends list
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Enhanced `updateMultiplayerUI()` to always call `loadFriendsList()` for real-time status updates
  - Added `user_unfriended` event listener in `multiplayer.js` with proper notification display
  - Added debugging logs to track online status detection for troubleshooting

- **Fix**: Enhanced `handleFriendRequestResponse` in `multiplayer.js` to show descriptive messages with emojis and use game's `showMessage` system
- **Issue 2**: Only one out of two friends was showing in friends list
- **Fix**: Corrected filtering logic in `loadFriendsList` from `&&` to `||` for `acceptedFriends` to show all accepted friends
- **Issue 3**: Basic friend request response messages needed improvement
- **Fix**: Enhanced `respondToFriendRequest` in `game.js` to show more descriptive and user-friendly messages
- **Files Modified**: `multiplayer.js`, `game.js`
- **Result**: Better friend request notifications and all accepted friends now display correctly
